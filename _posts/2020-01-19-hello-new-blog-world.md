## Hello!

Hello! My name is Michael Cascio and I'm a Project Manager at [SOM](https://www.som.com) focused on Research & Innovation type projects. Iâ€™m interested in ways of applying emerging technologies to the Architecture, Engineering, & Construction industry. I'm a Licensed Professional Engineer in New York and previously practiced Structural Engineering at SOM.

## Why Blog?

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1217909025259442176) by Jeremy Howard motivated me to put together this blog. Jeremy put together an extremely easy to use blog generator that leverages GitHub. I've written on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michael.cascio) in the past and am interested in writing more in the future. For better or worse, what's nice about this approach to setting up a personal blog is that the data for each post lives within my own repository.  

## Blog About What?

Here are some things that I'd like to write about in the future:

- Emerging technologies in the AEC industry
- Climate change & the built environment
- Personal & career development
- Other interesting life stuff

## Get In Touch

That's it for this post. Who knows when I'll get back to writing again. Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MCasiyo) or [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mscascio/) if you'd like to chat about anything.

Cheers,
Michael
